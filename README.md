# swarmtests

I'd like to work on code for simple "swarming" behavior, using javascript because it makes it easy to visualize behavior in the browser. This is that attempt.

I plan on starting with simple cursor-following behavior, and add more "intelligence" over time. It probably won't be very refined, because I want to test my own intuitions before looking at how others solve this problem. The main goal for now is to have a group of objects follow the cursor, self-determine movement within a certain range of the cursor, and avoid each other.
